Hello! My name is nhcarrigan, and I'm a web developer. This blog is here to serve as a place to dump my personal thoughts and ramblings, and may or may not be related to software development.

Some posts might be related to gaming, some might be related to current events, and some might be related to nothing at all.

Regardless, I hope you enjoy what I share and stick around!
